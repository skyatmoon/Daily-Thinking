How human can thinking without any language?

If one people never learn any language, he will think like:

apple->tree->apple-tree  : All these are may be pictures in the mind

but a human learned English:

apple-tree: tree can birth apple !!! It is a scentence!!

Why learning English is so hard for me!!!
